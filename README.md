## 📌 Problem Statement

Education-to-Industry Bridge System for Skill Alignment and Opportunity Matching

There exists a significant disconnect between academic learning and industry requirements. Educational institutions focus on theoretical knowledge while industries demand practical skills. Students lack clarity on relevant skills and pathways to employment, while companies struggle to identify job-ready talent. Existing platforms (LinkedIn, Coursera, Internshala) operate in silos, failing to create a seamless, intelligent bridge between learning, validation, and hiring.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Semgrep (for optional code scanning features)
- MetaMask (for blockchain features)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/LYFMATR.git
cd LYFMATR
```

### 2. Backend Setup (Node.js)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Set up your .env file with DB credentials, JWT secret, Gemini API key
npm run dev
```

Backend runs at `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. VR & ML Service Setup (Python)

```bash
cd ../vr-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Service runs at `http://localhost:8000`  
API docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### 4. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at `http://localhost:5173`

### 5. Database Setup

Execute `backend/db/schema.sql` in your PostgreSQL instance to create tables and seed sample data.

## 🧠 How It Works

### AI Skill Gap Analysis Flow

1. Student selects a target internship or project from the dashboard
2. Backend fetches student's skills and opportunity's required skills
3. Gemini API compares both sets and returns missing skills, match percentage, and a recommended learning path
4. Result is displayed with actionable steps and suggested courses

### Direct Agreement (Task‑to‑Hire) Flow

1. Company posts a "Task" with eligibility criteria (skills, certifications)
2. Eligible students view the task, complete it, and submit their work
3. Company reviews submissions and selects top performers
4. LYFMATR generates a smart contract (Polygon) outlining terms
5. Both parties sign digitally; the student is hired based on proven work

### VR Learning Flow

1. User enters the VR Campus via browser (WebXR)
2. Chooses a skill lab (e.g., Cloud Architecture)
3. Interacts with 3D holographic components guided by an AI tutor
4. Completes interactive assessments that validate skill acquisition
5. Earns an NFT badge stored on‑chain

### Membership & Monetization Flow

1. Free tier provides basic access
2. Users upgrade to Warrior (monthly) or King (yearly) via integrated payment
3. Tier unlocks additional video calls, VR content, unlimited task applications, and exclusive competitions

## 📈 Scalability

- **Backend** can be containerized with Docker and orchestrated via Kubernetes to handle thousands of concurrent users
- **Scan/AI workers** are decoupled using Celery + Redis, allowing parallel processing of Gemini requests and VR content generation
- **Database** uses PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for efficient skill embedding similarity search; can scale horizontally with read replicas
- **VR assets** are served via CDN for low‑latency global access
- **Frontend** is a static build deployable to Vercel/Netlify with automatic global edge caching

---

## 💡 Feasibility

LYFMATR is built entirely on battle‑tested open‑source technologies — React, Node.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and WebXR standards. The architecture separates concerns cleanly (main API, ML/VR service, frontend) and requires no specialized hardware beyond a modern browser. All third‑party integrations (Gemini, Daily.co, Polygon) have generous free tiers and straightforward SDKs. The project is production‑ready for a pilot launch with minimal infrastructure cost.

---

## 🌟 Novelty

No existing platform combines **AI‑powered skill gap analysis, immersive VR learning, blockchain‑verified credentials, and direct task‑based hiring** into a single, unified ecosystem. LYFMATR eliminates fragmentation by owning the entire lifecycle: **Learn → Practice → Validate → Connect → Rise**. The inclusion of WebXR‑based skill labs and VR interview simulators is unique in the ed‑tech/HR‑tech intersection, and the "Become the First King of Your Bloodline" narrative creates a powerful emotional hook that differentiates it from sterile job boards.

---

## 🔧 Feature Depth

- **AI Analysis** provides not just skill lists but actionable learning paths with external course recommendations
- **VR Realm** supports both A‑Frame (rapid prototyping) and Three.js (complex interactions) with spatialized voice chat
- **Membership Tiers** offer granular access control to video calls, VR content, and exclusive MNC competitions
- **Direct Agreements** use actual smart contracts on Polygon L2, reducing gas fees and enabling trustless hiring
- **Arena Competitions** include real‑time leaderboards, sponsor branding, and automated prize distribution
- **Skill DNA Embeddings** stored in `pgvector` enable "people like you" career trajectory predictions

---

## ⚠️ Responsible Use & Disclaimer

LYFMATR is designed to democratize access to career opportunities and skill development. Users are expected to:

- Provide accurate information in profiles and task submissions
- Respect the time and privacy of mentors and recruiters during video calls
- Use the VR environments in a safe, non‑harmful manner

Companies posting tasks or competitions must adhere to fair hiring practices and not discriminate based on protected characteristics.

The platform is **not** a guarantee of employment; it is a tool to increase visibility and readiness.

*"Every dynasty begins with one person who dared to rise."*
```# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Oxc](https://oxc.rs)
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/)

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
